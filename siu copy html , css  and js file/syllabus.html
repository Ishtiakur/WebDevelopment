In addition to these two regular semesters, there may be a short semester in the intervening period between end of semester I and commencement of semester II. During this short semester, students according to their needs may take additional course either to make up deficiencies in credit and grade point average (GPA) requirements or to fulfill the credits requirements for degree thus spending less time than the normal duration.</p>
			<h4>Duration of Semester</h4>
			<p>Duration of each of semester-I and semester-II will ordinarily be six months consisting of 18 weeks academic engagement as detailed as detailed below :</p>

			<p>The undergraduate and graduate programs are covered through a set of  theoretical and laboratory course, fieldwork, design and project/thesis work. Please refer to individual department for course listings.</p>
			
			<h4>Assignment of Credits</h4>
			<p style="margin-left:50px">1.<span style="text-size:20px"> Theoretical Courses : </span>one lecture per week per semester will be equivalent to one credit Thus a three credit hour course will have three lectures per week through a semester.</p>
			<p style="margin-left:50px">2.<span style="text-size:20px"> Laboratory/Field/Design/Project/Thesis work : </span>Credits for laboratory/Field/or design work usually will be half of the theoretical call hours per semester. Credits are also assigned to project/thesis work taken by students. The amount of credits assigned to each of these may vary from discipline to discipline.</p>
			
			<h3>Types of courses</h3>
			<p>General Courses : There will be some general courses compulsory for all undergraduate students in order to provide them a good grounding to become graduate, language proficiency, acquaintance with history and culture of our society, computer skills etc, will be the objectives of theses courses.</p>
			<p>Core Courses : In each discipline a number of compulsory courses will be identified as core courses which form the nucleus of a degree programme.</p>
			<p>Elective Courses: Apart from the core courses, students will have to complete a number of courses which are elective in nature so that students may have some choice in selecting these curse according to the desired field of concentration.</p>
			<p>Internship : The internship program is to be carried out in an organization, usually in the from of applied research work in the relevant area of concentration. The internship program is to be offered at the end of fourth year (Final Year) of study. After completion of 3 months program students are students are allowed one month more to prepare the report and sit for an interview on that program. A 3 credits hour of weight is allotted for the program.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:30px">Grading System : The total performance of a student in a given curse is evaluated on the basic of a scheme of continuous assessment is made through homework, assignment, attendance,  quizzes etc. a mid semester examination and a semester examination and a semester final examination of three/two hours duration.

			<p>The assessment in laboratory/field work courses is made through observation of the student at work in class, viva-voce during laboratory hour and quizzes. For students in engineering subjects, assessment in design/drawing would be done through evolution of a number of projects assigned to students throughout the semester. Each course has a letter grade equivalent to certain to number of grade points.</p>
