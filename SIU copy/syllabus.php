			<h4>Assignment of Credits</h4>
			<p style="margin-left:50px">1.<span style="text-size:20px"> Theoretical Courses : </span>one lecture per week per semester will be equivalent to one credit Thus a three credit hour course will have three lectures per week through a semester.</p>
			<p style="margin-left:50px">2.<span style="text-size:20px"> Laboratory/Field/Design/Project/Thesis work : </span>Credits for laboratory/Field/or design work usually will be half of the theoretical call hours per semester.

			<p>The assessment in laboratory/field work courses is made through observation of the student at work in class, viva-voce during laboratory hour and quizzes. For students in engineering subjects, assessment in design/drawing would be done through evolution of a number of projects assigned to students throughout the semester. Each course has a letter grade equivalent to certain to number of grade points.</p>

				<li>Cumulative <strong>GPA</strong> falls below 2.25</li>
				<li>Earned credits fall below 15 times the number of semesters studied.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>All such students can make up deficiencies in <strong>GPA</strong> and credit requirements by completing course in next semester(s) and making up backlog course, if their be any.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Rules for course offered in short semester </strong></p>
